I'm working on an AI project, here the informations about it:

It is a project that aims to develop an AI based on models like GPT or it can be others type of models than llm if you think it is better.

On wordpress there are blocks, for example all the core blocks, here for example a paragraph block
```html
<!-- wp:paragraph {"metadata":{"bindings":{"content":{"source":"twentytwentyfive/format"}}},"fontSize":"small"} -->
<p class="has-small-font-size"></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
```

With a theses blocks, we can build full functionnal pages, theses assembly of blocks are named "patterns".
Patterns are a way to organize and reuse blocks in a consistent way.
I got 1200 patterns that each are made of differents blocks.
The goal is to create an AI that can generate patterns that fit together and create new patterns that are unique and creative.
I want that AI based on block, to develop full wordpress webpages.

Here is the context of the project, tell me all the additional context you need to know to help me develop this AI.
I have no idea where to begin
So how can i create an AI that can generate wordpress pages, with theses wordpress blocks, i can provide the full core/block references, and all the pattern to maybe train the AI

# me
I got some background with CPP, C, Python, Rust and JavaScript.
I am mostly working on a vps on the cloud
I can get some budget for this project, but probably no more than 100$

# Patterns Info
I have 1200 patterns
Each pattern got a name and a list of 1 to 12 tags
I can get a rendered version of each pattern
The patterns are stored in a database
I got all type of patterns from commercial to blog and portfolio

# AI
The AI must generate full pages
it must ensure that blocks are compatible with each other
it must ensure that the generated pages are valid and functional
it must ensure that the generated pages are optimized for SEO
it would be given a theme
